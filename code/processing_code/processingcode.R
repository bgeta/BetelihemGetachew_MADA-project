# This dataset has  4643 number of observations and 608 variables, as part of the data cleaning process 
# The first thing will be to select only variables of interest to make the dataset more managable.
#The variables included in this study are 
#sociodemographics -  A01 (Gender), AGE, A04 (Educational level), A05 (Employment status), Wealth (Wealth index)
#A11 (Marital Status), Residence. 
#Tobacco Smoking - B01 (Do you currenlty smoke tobacco on a daily basis(1), less than daily (2), not at all(3), 
#B04 (Age when you first started smoking daily), B07 (smoking how soon after you wake up),B06A (number of cigarettes smoked), B07 (how soon after you wake you do you usually smoke ( 1-within 5 minutes, 2 - 6 to 30 minutes, 3 -  31 to 60 minutes, 4 -  more than 60 minutes))
# Cessation  - D08 ( thinking about quitting, 1 -  quit within the next month, 2 -  thiking within teh next 12 months, 3 -  quit someday but not next 12 months, 4 -  not interested in quitting)
#Media - G201A1 (noticed information about the dangers of tobacco products 1 - Yes, 2 - No 7- dont know), G201B2 (noticed on televeision)
# G201C1 on Radion , G201D1 on billboards, G201E1 (somewhere else), D01 quit attempt
#G202 (notice warnings on cig packages)

## ---- cleandata4 --------
# Inspecting the data, we find some problems that need addressing:
# First, there is an entry for height which says "sixty" instead of a number. 
# Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn't make
# sense since the weight is 60kg, which can't happen for a 60cm person (a baby)
# Since we don't know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person.
# This "sixty" entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.
# That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn't very meaningful.
# So let's fix that first.
